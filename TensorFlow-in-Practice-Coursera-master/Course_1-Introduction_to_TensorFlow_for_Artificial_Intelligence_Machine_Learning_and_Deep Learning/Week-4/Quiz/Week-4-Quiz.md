#### 1. Using Image Generator, how do you label images?
##### Ans: It’s based on the directory the image is contained in
#### 2. What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?
##### Ans: rescale
#### 3. How did we specify the training size for the images?
##### Ans: The target_size parameter on the training generator
#### 4. When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?
##### Ans: Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color
#### 5. If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?
##### Ans: You’re overfitting on your training data
#### 6. Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:
##### Ans: 
- In these images, the features may be in different parts of the frame
- There’s a wide variety of horses
- There’s a wide variety of humans
- All of the above
#### 7. After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?
##### Ans: We removed some convolutions to handle the smaller images
